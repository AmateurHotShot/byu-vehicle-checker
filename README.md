# byu-vehicle-checker

This is a quick python script that I wrote to send me a text message when the BYU vehicle surplus website offers vehicles for sale or auction.

Their sales are usually lightning sales, and I want to be able to hop on them as soon as they happened.

This was an afternoon project, and implementing SMS with python, and hosting it on a raspberry pi was a unique stack to work with.
